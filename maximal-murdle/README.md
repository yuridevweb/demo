###

If you're not familiar with Wordle's rules, they're fairly easy to get to grips with. You have 6 chances to guess a 5-letter word. Type in and enter a guess, and you'll be shown which (if any) letters are in the right place when they turn green. Letters that turn yellow are in the word, but in the wrong place. After your 6th guess, if you still haven't guessed the right word, you lose the game.

But wait! This isn't _only_ Wordle, here!

Maximal(Murdle) offers 2 other ways in which you can meet your doom! If the clock runs out, I'm afraid it's curtains. Equally, just as in hangman, guess too many wrong letters and you'll lose all your lives.

Too difficult? There's only one way to find out! Challenge your friends, rise up the leaderboard, and show the world you're afraid of nothing! Nothing a little Murdle can't cure...

# How to Run the Game Locally

You will need an Android Device or an emulator such as provided by Android Studio to run the game.

```

### ✔️ 2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)

```
$ npm install
```

### ✔️ 3. FIREBASE

![Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/firebase-%23039BE5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase)

Follow the steps outlined in the official documentation to [set up your own connection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start) to Firebase.

### ✔️ 4. USAGE

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white) ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37)

Start your local server with:

```
expo start
```

In the CLI a prompt will appear to go to [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002). From the page it opens you can select to connect via tunnel. Using the Expo Go app, or your phone's camera, scan the QR code. You will be prompted to install Expo Go if you do not already have it on your phone.

## Node.js and Expo

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37)

This project was created using:

```
$ node -v | v16.15.0
$ expo -v | 45.0.0
```

The above commands will also enable you to check your own versions in the terminal. **At the time of writing, Expo is not compatible with Node versions later than 16.15.0.**

If you have a later version of Node running on your computer, you can alter this:

```
$ nvm use 16.15
```

If you do not have this version installed, NVM will prompt you to install it and then rerun the above command.
